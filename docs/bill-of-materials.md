# Bill of Materials

## Available lab materials

The following list specifies necessary hardware components that were made
available without purchase from the lab section. We utilized the CC3200
LaunchPad and OLED that were provided during the first session of lab 1
("Development Tools Tutorial and Lab Introduction"). Furthermore, we used the IR
remote, decoder, resistor, and capacitor that were handed out for lab 3 ("IR
Remote Control Texting Over a UART Link"). To solder pin headers onto the GPS
and compass modules, we used the soldering iron and solder wire that were
available in the lab room.

* **1 CC3200 LaunchPad** (Lab Provided)
* **1 AT&T S3 IR universal remote control** to provide user
input (Lab Provided)
* **1 Vishay TSOP383xx** to decode IR remote signals (Lab
Provided)
* **1 100Ω resistor** to construct a low-pass filter for filtering
noise on the IR decoder’s power source (Lab Provided)
* **1 100µF capacitor** to construct a low-pass filter for filtering
noise on the IR decoder’s power source (Lab Provided)
* **1 RGB 128x128 Adafruit SSD1351 OLED Display** to display pages for the user interface (Lab Provided)
* **1 soldering iron** to solder pin headers onto the GPS and
compass modules (Lab Provided)
* **1 pack of solder wire** to solder pin headers onto the GPS
and compass modules (Lab Provided)

Furthermore, we already owned an **830-tie point breadboard** and
**a set of breadboard jumper wires** to physically connect the components. We
also owned **pin headers** to solder onto the GPS and compass modules.

## Purchased equipment

In addition to the equipment we personally owned or acquired from lab, we needed
three other products that required purchasing: a breadboard power supply,
GPS module, and compass module (to prepare for attempting our compass stretch
goal). In total, we spent $42.47 excluding tax.

### Breadboard power supply

A breadboard power supply is required to make our device an interactive handheld
device so that the Launchpad does not need to be connected to a computer for
power. The SunFounder BreadVolt module consists of a recharge-able battery and
two power outputs for 5-volts and 3.3-volts. The 5-volt output supplies power to
the GPS module. The 3.3-volt output supplies power to the LaunchPad, IR receiver,
and OLED display. This product was purchased on Amazon for $9.99 at this
[link](https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Breadboard-Rechargeble-Battery-Compatible/dp/B0D31CWN3X).

### GPS module

To retrieve the user’s real-time location as they physically move, our project
requires a GPS module so we can read the latitude and longitude. We purchased a
HGLRC M100-5883 GPS module on Amazon for $19.99 at this

### Compass sensor

For a stretch goal, we thought about integrating a compass sensor for rendering
an arrow that directs the user to the nearest Pokémon. Thus, we bought a
Waveshare Bosch BMM150 3-axis digital compass sensor. The product was purchased
on Amazon for $12.49 at this
