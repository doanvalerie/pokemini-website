## Overview

To showcase the knowledge we gained from the course EEC 172 – Embedded Systems,
we exercise the skills taught in labs to design and implement a final project
with increased complexity and creativity. Our project is titled Pokémini Go, an
application that is inspired by the popular game Pokémon Go. For context,
Pokémon Go is a mobile application that uses augmented reality and the phone's
GPS sensor to spawn collectible characters, called Pokémon, on a real-world map.
To capture Pokémon, users must physically walk to real-world locations where the
characters had spawned. As the user physically moves, their real-time location
updates on a map displayed in the application. When the user reaches close
proximity to that Pokémon, they can attempt to catch it and add it to their
collection. Our project Pokémini Go is a simplified version of Pokémon Go.
Pokémini Go implements the core functionality of Pokémon Go by spawning Pokémon
characters at real coordinates. Users must walk to these coordinates to battle
the Pokémon and add it to their collection.
